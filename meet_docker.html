          If you are an aspiring <span class="highlight-purple">Developer</span> or <span class="highlight-purple">SRE</span>, you will eventually come across the term <span class="highlight-purple">DOCKER</span>! Docker is essential these days. The main goal of this write-up is to explain everything I have learned about Docker, from basics to intermediate to advanced. It’s a win-win scenario: I will be explaining what I’ve learned (which helps reinforce my understanding – <span class="highlight-purple">Feynman Technique</span>), and you will have the opportunity to learn what you might have missed or want to revise. Let's get started!

          What is Docker?
        </div>
        <div class="content-sub">
          Docker is a tool for containerization. Is that all? Yes, that’s it. Similar to Docker, there are many other containerization tools such as Podman, CRI-O, Containerd, and rkt (Rocket). So, our focus now is to answer the question: What is <span class="highlight-purple">containerization?</span>

          What is Containerization?
        </div>
        <div class="content-sub">
          Containerization is the process of running different processes in isolation with their own dependencies on a single local system.
It may seem simple, but let’s dive deeper into the problems it solves.

          You have two Python applications that you want to run on your local system. The Python version on your system is 3.10, but one application requires Python 3.7 and the other requires Python 3.8.
You think, "Let’s give it a try. What if it runs anyway?" You attempt to run the first application, but it throws an error: "RuntimeError: This application requires Python 3.7 or above. Current version: 3.10."
          Sad :(<br><br>
You decide to downgrade your Python version to 3.7. Now it works for the first application, but what about the second application? Upgrading to Python 3.8? While this might work once, you can't run both applications simultaneously on your system.
          <br> <br>Wait! You still have a comeback left, you might consider using Python virtual environments. <br><br>While virtual environments like venv or pyenv can help manage different Python versions and prevent package conflicts, they can't solve problems related to OS differences. Sometimes code that runs fine on your system fails on a colleague’s system due to differences in OS and system libraries. This issue is not unique to Python; other languages like C/C++, Go, Rust, and Node.js face similar challenges. Although these languages have their own methods for managing packages and versions, the problem of OS and system library differences remains.

          On any given day, if you choose to use VMs (virtual machines) to run applications with different dependencies to achieve isolation on a single local system, think again!<br><br>
          It's true that VMs can help prevent the problem we face regarding system dependencies and differences in OSs. However, it’s a very resource-intensive solution.<br><br>
VMs use OS images (e.g., .iso files), which include a bootloader, kernel, filesystems, packages, etc., to load an operating system inside your local system that already has its own OS running. Essentially, VMs give us the ability to run multiple operating systems inside a single local system, but using VMs solely to run applications is not an efficient solution. Just imagine: your CPU and RAM are now being utilized by the kernel and system programs of both your local system and the VMs simultaneously. Therefore, running multiple VMs just to support applications is resource-intensive. This can significantly degrade the performance of both your system and the applications, placing a heavy load on your resources.
